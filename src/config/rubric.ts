// The email rubric v1 this site was seeded from. The social rubric keeps its
// mechanics (8 dimensions, 1 to 5, 8 to 40, the same bands) and replaces the
// keys and display names when its contract is final. Once published, keys
// are part of the content contract and must not change; only display names may.
// offer_clarity displays as "Clarity" and personalization as "Relevance" so
// every dimension applies to every send (welcome and transactional included).
